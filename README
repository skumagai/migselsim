2deme_mig_simulator
===================

Tracking gene genealogies of autosomal, X-linked, Y-lined, and
mitochondrial neutral markers forward in time under two-deme
structured population genetic model.  Additionally, locally adapted
non-neutral loci, whose genealogies are not tracked, can be included
in simulation to study the effect of non-neutral loci on a set of
neutral markers.
