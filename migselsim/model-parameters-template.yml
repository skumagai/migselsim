genetic structure:
  # ploidy can take 1 (haploid), 2 (diploid), or a special value HAPLODIPLOID.
  ploidy: 2
  chromosomes:
    # sequence of chromosomes.
    - type:   autosome
      # type of chromosome (string) [required]
      # one of autosome, x, y, and mitochondria are supported.
      id:     autosome 1
      # id of chromosome (string) [required]
      # arbitrary string for the name of a chromosome
      number of loci: 2
      # total number of loci (integer) [required]
      # includes both neutral and non-neutral loci.
      non-neutral loci:
      # holds information about non-neutral loci in locus-by-locus fashion.
      # it's very verbose. yes i know.
        - position: 0
          # position of non-neutral locus zero-based.
          initial frequency: 0.1
          # initial frequency of allele, whose fitness is coded not unity (!= 1).
          # This can take one of several forms.
          # The first form is a single float for sex- and location-nonspecific case.
          # The second form is a list of floats for sex-nonspecific but location-specific case
          # e.g. [0.1, 0.2] for the frequency in the first deme is initially at 0.1, and
          # in the second deme 0.2.
          # The third form is a map of two items with key 'male' and 'female' for sex-specific
          # but location-nonspedific case.
          # e.g. male: 0.1
          #      female: 0.2
          # The last form is for sex- and  location-specific case.  The format is a hybrid of
          # the second and third forms.
          # e.g. - male: 0.1
          #        female: 0.2
          #      - male: 0.3
          #        female: 0.4.
          # It is not supported to mix any of four forms for now.
      recombination rate: 0.5
      # recombination rates (real or sequence) [optional]
      # if omitted, all loci are free to recombine (1/2).
      # if a scalar value is given, all loci recombine at the rate.
      # if sequence, whose length is one less than the number of loci, is given,
      # i-th element in the sequence specifies the recombination rate
      # between i-th and (i+1)-th loci.
      #
      # instead, 'recombination after loci' can be specified,
      # but both cannot be specified at the same time.
      recombination after loci:
        loci: {0, 2, 4}
        # index of loci after which recombination can occur
        # (seqeuence) [required]
        # NOT IMPLEMENTED
        rate: {}
        # rate of recombinations (sequence) [requried]
        # recombination rate after the loci specified in 'loci'.

      id: X
      number of loci: 1
population structure:
  # population structure
  population size: 500
  # local population size (integer or sequence) [required]
  # if a scalar value is given, all subpopulations used the value.
  # if sequence is given, population size of i-th subpopulation is
  # i-th element of this seqeunce.
  # the length of sequnce has to be identical to number of demes,
  mating scheme:
    mating type: random mating
    number of offspring per mating: 1
    offspring sex:
      proportion of male: 0.5
      # mode determine how to assign sexes to offspring.  If the value is 'exact'
      # exactly 'proportion of male' of offspring is male.  If the value is
      # 'by probability' each offspring has `'proportion of male` change of
      # being male.
      mode: exact
number of replicates: 1
  # number of runs (integer) [optional]
  # if omitted, single simulation is performed.
