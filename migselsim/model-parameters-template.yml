genetic structure:
  chromosomes:
    # sequence of chromosomes.
    - type:   autosome
      # type of chromosome (string) [required]
      # one of autosome, x, y, and mitochondria are supported.
      id:     autosome 1
      # id of chromosome (string) [required]
      # arbitrary string for the name of a chromosome
      number of loci: 2
      # total number of loci (integer) [required]
      # includes both neutral and non-neutral loci.
      non-neutral loci:
      # holds information about non-neutral loci in locus-by-locus fashion.
      # it's very verbose. yes i know.
        - position: 0
          # position of non-neutral locus zero-based.
          number of alleles: 2
          # number of alleles.  This entry takes integer as low as 2 and as high as 255.
          # The lower bound is given by the fact that at least two alleles are needed in order
          # for a locus to be non-neutral.
          # The upper bound comes from the limitation of 'lineage' version of simuPOP, which
          # stores allelic information encoded in 8 bits unsign integer type.
          initial frequency: [0.2, 0.8]
          # initial frequencies of alleles given as a list, whose elements sum to unity.
          # Length of this list must be the number of alleles.
          #
          # This can take one of several forms depending on whether frequencies are
          # sex- or deme-specific.
          #
          # The first form is for cases without any specificity.  Frequencies are simpliy given
          # as a list.
          # e.g. [0.2, 0.8]
          #
          # The second form is for deme-specific cases.  Frequencies are given as a nested list.
          # Inner list represents frequencies in a single deme.
          # e.g. [[0.1, 0.9], [0.3, 0.7]]
          #
          # The third form is for sex-specific cases.  Frequencies are given as a dict with two
          # keys 'male' and 'female'.  Values of each key are list of sex-specific frequencies.
          # e.g. {male: [0.1, 0.9]
          #       female: [0.3, 0.7]}
          #
          # The last form is for both sex- and deme-specific case.  As this is a superset of
          # second and third forms.  Its format is also a super set of those forms.
          # Frequencies are given as a list of dicts.  Each dict corresponds to deme-specific
          # initial frequencies, which are sex specific.
          # e.g. [{male: [0.1, 0.9], female: [0.3, 0.7]},
          #       {male: [0.9, 0.1], female: [0.7, 0.3]}
          #  for two-deme system.
          selection coefficient: {'(0,0)': 0.1, '(0,1)': 0.2, '(1,1)': 0.3}
          # The basic idea is to assign selection coefficient to each genotype represtented as
          # a tuple, and the tuples are keys in a dict of coefficients.  Note that (0,1) is
          # considered to be identical genotype as (1,0) so that only one of them needs to be
          # specified.  Because of this lack of specificity in simuPOP design, it is currently
          # not possible to assign selection coefficients based on maternality or paternality.
          #
          # Another thing to note is that selection coefficient and initial frequency have to
          # have the same form.  For example, if initial frequency is given for a case without
          # sex- and deme-specificity, then selection coefficients has to be given for the
          # exact same case.
          #
          # Moreover, genotypes must be given as string (quoted within quotation characters).
          # This is because of limitation in yaml format.
          #
          # Similar to initial frequencies, this entry could take four forms depending on
          # specificity in sex or deme.
          #
          # The first form is for cases specific neither in sex nor deme.  Then, a single dict
          # is used.
          #
          # The second form is a list of dict for deme-specific cases. Each dict is
          # deme-speccific selection coefficients.
          #
          # The third form is a dict of dicts for sex-specific cases.  The outer dict has
          # two kyes, 'male' and 'female', and each key holds a dict of sex-specific selection
          # coefficients.
          #
          # The last form is a list of dicts of dicts for sex- and deme-specific cases.
          # e.g. [{male: {(0,0): 0.1, (0,1): 0.2, (1,1): 0.3},
          #        female: {(0,0): 0.3, (0,1): 0.2, (1,1): 0.1}},
          #       {male: {(0,0): 0.4, (0,1): 0.5, (1,1): 0.6},
          #        female: {(0,0): 0.6, (0,1): 0.5, (1,1): 0.4}}]
      recombination scheme:
        rate: 0.01
        # recombination rate between two neighboring loci.  This can take a single float
        # for uniform recombination rate at all recombination sites, a list, whose length
        # equals the length of 'at' list, for site-specific recombination rates.  Note that
        # these forms are for sex-nonspecific cases.
        #
        # For sex-specific cases, a dict with keys 'male' and 'female' can be used.  For
        # each entry, value is either a float or a list as in the base cases.
        #
        # Unlike selection scheme, deme-specific recombination is not supported.

    # Let M be a migration matrix of either type.  Row indicates the source deme,
    # and column indicates the target deme.  Note that i and j are zero-based.
    # For example m_{1,2} is probability/proportion of migrants from the second deme to
    # the third deme.  Furthermore, m_{ii} is an entry corresponding to nonmigrants.
    # There is an restriction such that \sum_{j} m_{ij} = 1.  Otherwise, each row will be
