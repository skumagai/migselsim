genetic structure:
  ploidy: 2
  chromosomes:
    # sequence of chromosomes.
    - type:   autosome
      # type of chromosome (string) [required]
      # one of autosome, x, y, and mitochondria are supported.
      id:     autosome 1
      # id of chromosome (string) [optional]
      # arbitrary string for the name of a chromosome
      number of loci: 2
      # total number of loci (integer) [required]
      # includes both neutral and non-neutral loci.
      position of non-neutral loci: 0
      # position of non-neutral locus (integer or seqeunce of integers) [optional]
      recombination rate: 0.5
      # recombination rates (real or sequence) [optional]
      # if omitted, all loci are free to recombine (1/2).
      # if a scalar value is given, all loci recombine at the rate.
      # if sequence, whose length is one less than the number of loci, is given,
      # i-th element in the sequence specifies the recombination rate
      # between i-th and (i+1)-th loci.
      #
      # instead, 'recombination after loci' can be specified,
      # but both cannot be specified at the same time.
      recombination after loci:
        loci: {0, 2, 4}
        # index of loci after which recombination can occur
        # (seqeuence) [required]
        # NOT IMPLEMENTED

    - type: x
      number of loci: 1
population structure:
  # population structure
  population size: 500
  # local population size (integer or sequence) [required]
  # if a scalar value is given, all subpopulations used the value.
  # if sequence is given, population size of i-th subpopulation is
  # i-th element of this seqeunce.
  # the length of sequnce has to be identical to number of demes,
  mating scheme:
    mating type: random mating
    number of offspring per mating: 1
    offspring sex:
      proportion of male: 0.5
      exact: True
      by probability: False
number of replicates: 1
  # number of runs (integer) [optional]
  # if omitted, single simulation is performed.
