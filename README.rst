A forward-in-time population genetic simulator.
Simulations track gene genealogies of autosomal, X-linked, Y-lined, and
mitochondrial neutral markers in unstructured or structured
population.
Additionally this simulator can incorporate the effect of locally adapted non-neutral loci.  This software is implemented on top of _simuPOP.
